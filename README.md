# PhysicalDesign-SignoffSaga
PhysicalDesign-SignoffSaga is my portfolio documenting the complete ASIC Physical Design journey — from RTL to GDSII — using industry-standard EDA tools (Cadence & Synopsys).

**To explore my work with open-source EDA tools and see an alternative implementation of the RTL-to-GDSII flow, check out my [RTL2GDS_Alchemy](https://github.com/TheVoltageVikingRam/RTL2GDS_Alchemy) repository.**
