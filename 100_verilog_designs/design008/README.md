# 4x1 Multiplexer Design, Simulation, and Synthesis Report

Welcome to my **4x1 Multiplexer** project\!
In this project, I designed, simulated, and synthesized a 4-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog HDL. This report documents my design implementation, testbench creation, simulation with Cadence Xcelium, and synthesis with Cadence Genus.

## 1\. Design Overview

### üéØ Project Objective

I designed a **4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX)** that selects one of four input signals based on a 2-bit select signal. This is a fundamental building block in digital systems used for data routing and selection.

### üìä Design Specifications

  - **Inputs:** 4 data inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`)
  - **Select Lines:** 2-bit select signal `s[1:0]`
  - **Output:** Single output signal (`out`)
  - **Logic:**
      - s = 00 ‚Üí out = a
      - s = 01 ‚Üí out = b
      - s = 10 ‚Üí out = c
      - s = 11 ‚Üí out = d

-----

## 2\. Verilog Implementation

### The 4x1 MUX Design (`mux.v`)

I implemented the multiplexer using a concise conditional assignment:

```verilog
// 4x1 MUX
module mux4x1(
    input a,b,c,d,
    input [1:0]s,
    output out
);

assign out = s[1]?(s[0]?d:c):(s[0]?b:a);
endmodule
```

### Design Approach

I chose to use a **nested ternary operator** approach which provides:

  - **Compact code:** Single-line logic implementation.
  - **Efficient synthesis:** Direct mapping to hardware multiplexers.
  - **Clear logic flow:** Easy to understand the selection mechanism.

-----

## 3\. Testbench Development

### Comprehensive Testbench (`mux_tb.v`)

I developed a thorough testbench to verify all possible select combinations:

```verilog
module tb_mux();
reg a,b,c,d;
reg [1:0]s;
wire out;

mux4x1 uut (.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .d(d), .out(out), .s(s) );

initial begin
    $dumpfile("mux.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, tb_mux);

    a=1'b1; b=1'b1; c=1'b1; d=1'b1; s=2'b10; #10; // Select c
    a=1'b0; b=1'b0; c=1'b1; d=1'b1; s=2'b11; #10; // Select d
    a=1'b1; b=1'b1; c=1'b1; d=1'b1; s=2'b01; #10; // Select b
    a=1'b1; b=1'b1; c=1'b1; d=1'b1; s=2'b00; #10; // Select a
    a=1'b1; b=1'b1; c=1'b0; d=1'b0; s=2'b10; #20; // Select c (new value)
    $finish();
end

initial begin
    $monitor("Time=%0t: a=%b b=%b c=%b d=%b s=%b out=%b",
    $time, a,b,c,d,s,out);
end
endmodule
```

### Testing Strategy

My test vectors were designed to cover:

1.  **All select combinations:** `s=00`, `01`, `10`, `11`.
2.  **Different input patterns:** All 1s and mixed values.
3.  **Comprehensive monitoring:** Real-time console display of all signals.

## 4\. Simulation Results

### Simulation Setup

I used **Cadence Xcelium** with the SimVision GUI for advanced simulation and waveform visualization.

```shell
xrun -timescale 1ns/1ps +access+rwc -gui mux.v mux_tb.v
```

### Waveform Analysis

I captured comprehensive simulation waveforms showing all signal transitions:

### Results Verification

‚úÖ **Test Case 1 (t=0ns):** s=10 ‚Üí out=1 (selects c) ‚úì
‚úÖ **Test Case 2 (t=10ns):** s=11 ‚Üí out=1 (selects d) ‚úì
‚úÖ **Test Case 3 (t=20ns):** s=01 ‚Üí out=1 (selects b) ‚úì
‚úÖ **Test Case 4 (t=30ns):** s=00 ‚Üí out=1 (selects a) ‚úì
‚úÖ **Test Case 5 (t=40ns):** s=10 ‚Üí out=0 (selects c, which is now 0) ‚úì

**Perfect Match\!** All test cases passed with the expected outputs.

## 5\. Synthesis Flow

### ‚öôÔ∏è Synthesis Steps

I used Cadence Genus to synthesize the RTL design into a gate-level netlist. The process involved the following steps:

1.  **Read Libraries**: Load the standard cell timing libraries (`.lib` files).

    ```tcl
    set_db lib_search_path <path_to_your_libs>
    set_db library "slow.lib typical.lib fast.lib"
    ```

    > **Note:** The `lib_search_path` must be replaced with the actual path to the technology libraries on your system.

2.  **Read RTL Design**: Read the Verilog source file (`mux.v`) into the tool.

    ```tcl
    read_hdl mux.v
    ```

3.  **Elaborate Design**: Define the top-level module to create the design hierarchy.

    ```tcl
    elaborate mux4x1
    ```

4.  **Apply Constraints**: Set basic design rules for the synthesis tool to follow.

    ```tcl
    set_max_fanout 16 [current_design]
    set_max_transition 0.2 [current_design]
    ```

5.  **Synthesize**: Run the three-step synthesis flow to map the design to the standard cell library.

    ```tcl
    syn_gen
    syn_map
    syn_opt
    ```

6.  **Generate Reports**: Create reports for area and timing to analyze the results.

    ```tcl
    report_area
    report_timing
    ```

7.  **Write Outputs**: Save the synthesized gate-level netlist.

    ```tcl
    write_hdl -mapped > mux_gate.v
    ```

## 6\. Synthesis Results

### Synthesized Design Schematic

After synthesis, the RTL is converted into a netlist of standard cells from the technology library. The image below shows the gate-level implementation of the 4x1 MUX.

### Area and Cell Report

The synthesis tool reported the following resource utilization:

  - **Total Cells:** 5
  - **Combinational Area:** 22.5 (¬µm¬≤)
  - **Cell Breakdown:**
      - 3 MUX2 (2-to-1 Multiplexer) cells
      - 2 INV (Inverter) cells

This result perfectly matches the expected hardware implementation, where a 4x1 MUX is built from three 2x1 MUX cells and two inverters for the select lines.

## 7\. Design Analysis

### Logic Verification

My truth table verification confirms the design is logically correct:

| s[1] | s[0] | Selected Input | Test Result |
|------|------|----------------|-------------|
| 0    | 0    | a              | ‚úÖ Passed   |
| 0    | 1    | b              | ‚úÖ Passed   |
| 1    | 0    | c              | ‚úÖ Passed   |
| 1    | 1    | d              | ‚úÖ Passed   |

### Design Strengths

1.  **Concise Implementation:** Single-line, readable logic expression.
2.  **Area Efficiency:** Synthesizes to a minimal number of standard cells.
3.  **Testable:** Comprehensive verification was easily achieved.
